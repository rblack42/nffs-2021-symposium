\section{Wire Parts}

As I got to the end of this design, I wanted to finish it off by building the
wire parts. I managed to find a few examples on {Thingiverse} that provided
clues as to how I might do this. Unfortunately, the code is far too involved to
present here. Instead, I will show one image from my experiments.
