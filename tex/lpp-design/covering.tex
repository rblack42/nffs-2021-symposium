\section{Modeling the Covering<D-]>

\osc\ does not provide a simple way to add covering to our design. However, I
did find some code written by Justin Lin :\cite{lin} that can help. Justin
create a module called {\it Bezier Surface which takes an 3D matrix of control
points and fits a smooth surface through all those points. We can then plot the
smooth surface and give it a color so we can see it. I am using a blue glass
color which is transparent so we can see the structure behind the surface.

Even better, we can submit this surface to the same analysis we are using to
get weights and center of gravity data and add this new feature to our
analysis.

\subsection{Generating Control points}

This process depends on an array of control points which capture the basic
shape we wish to cover. The fin is not much of a challenge, but the wing and
stabilizer do present a few issues.

{\subsection{Center Sections}

Both the wing and stab have nice rectangular plan forms with the same circular
arc airfoil at all points. We can generate control points using the equations
for the airfoil, and step across the span using any step size we wish. Since
the airfoil is constant across the center span, we do not need a lot of points.
