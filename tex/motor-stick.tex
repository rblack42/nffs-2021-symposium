\section*{Motor Stick}

With the flying surfaces set up, we can now turn to the fuselage parts. The
most important of these is the motor stick, which supports everything else in
the model. The motor stick must also bear the forces imposed by the wound up
rubber motor that will power this craft.

We can set up the motor stick several ways, but I will use a {\it polygon} to
define the basic shape, then use {\it linear\_extrude} to generate the actual
object.

Here is the basic layout we will use:
