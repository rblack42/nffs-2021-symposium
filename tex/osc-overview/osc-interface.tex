\section{OpenSCAD}

Once you have \osc\ installed, open it up and take a look at the basic
interface:

\importimage{opening-screen}{OpenSCAd interface}

There are three areas we will be using in this view:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Editor - the left panel where you type in your code.}
\item{Preview - the top right panel will be where your model is displayed.}
\item{Messages - the bottom right panel is where error messages will be shown
when processing your code.}
\end{itemize}

I will not try to show everything you need to know about the language {\it
OpenSCAD} uses for describing a model. Instead, I will show fragments of code
to give you a feel for what you need to write to design your model. The project
website~\cite{blackr} has more details, as does the \osc\ {\it User
Manual}~\cite{userman}.

As you work through this article, you might find the \osc\ ``cheat-sheet'' to
be very handy. It is available here:~\cite{osccheat}.
